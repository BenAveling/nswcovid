# nswcovid

An interactive map of NSW showing selected publicly available Covid data:

<http://benaveling.github.io/nswcovid/map/>

Each little barchart represents cases/day for a geographic area over the last two weeks of available data.

Source data is from [data.gov.au](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/covid-19-cases-by-location/resource/21304414-1ff1-4243-a5d2-f52778048b29)

Be aware that the data will always be at least two days out of date.

Upstream data is never quite up to date and is often revised after being published - cases are added and removed and moved to different days or different areas. 

This is especially true for the last day of data - it's often around half the actual cases.  And therefore, the most recent day of data isn't displayed - it would be misleading to do so.
