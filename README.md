# nswcovid

An interactive map of NSW showing selected publicly available Covid data.

https://benaveling.github.io/nswcovid/map/

Each little barchart represents cases/day for a geographic area over the last two weeks, or so. 

The data will always be at least a day or two out of date, because the upstream data is out of date, and because no-one's being paid to do this.
