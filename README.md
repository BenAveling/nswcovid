# nswcovid

An interactive map of NSW showing selected publicly available Covid data:

<http://benaveling.github.io/nswcovid/map/>

Each little barchart represents cases/day for a geographic area over the last two weeks, or so. 

Source data is from [data.gov.au](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/covid-19-cases-by-location/resource/21304414-1ff1-4243-a5d2-f52778048b29)

Be aware that the data will always be at least a day or two out of date, because the upstream data is always a little out of date, and because no-one's being paid to do this.
