Painful that the order of the confirmed cases csv changes each time it gets downloaded

Means that there are a lot of not-real differences between version, unless I remember to sort it.

Tempting to stop saving the .csv file.

But there is a  continual trickle of updates to old entries - even months old entries can appear/disappear/change.

I'll try automatically sorting it. That might be best of both worlds.
