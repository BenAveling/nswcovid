Seems that NSW Gov has changed the format of the csv file - now have an extra column saying how many cases in postcode/whatever.

  https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/aefcde60-3b0c-4bc0-9af1-6fe652944ec2/resource/5d63b527-e2b8-4c42-ad6f-677f14433520/download/confirmed_cases_table1_location_agg.csv

sensible change, but breaks the scripts.

Painful that the order of the confirmed cases csv changes each time it gets downloaded

Means that there are a lot of not-real differences between version, unless I remember to sort it.

Tempting to stop saving the .csv file.

But there is a  continual trickle of updates to old entries - even months old entries can appear/disappear/change.

I'll try automatically sorting it. That might be best of both worlds.
